# ethernaut-solutions
Me working through the ethernaut series using Web3.fs

Various revisions of web3.fs have been used during this progression, including unreleased 'interim' versions for bugs fixes and attempted bug fixes, functionality modification, etc. The earliest scripts will be most out of sync, but shouldn't be too hard to bring in line with whatever v0.2.x web3.fs is on.

The level-x.fsx files require commenting out of various sections of code, as you might need deployed addresses, etc before later sections can run, etc. They will also include Solidity as block commented sections.

level-x.proof files contain transaction hashes and contract addresses as necessary to prove that the challenges were completed.

Between the two, it should be enough to 'show my work' that I actually did do these. The inelegance of some of my Solidity should aide in that determination. 😂

I'm purposely skipping level 26, as "learn to code our bot" isn't something I'm very interested in.
